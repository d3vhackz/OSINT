# IP, Domain, and File Reputation

## IP Reputation

### What is it?  
IP reputation refers to the evaluation of an IP address based on its historical activity and associations. This helps determine whether the IP is likely to be safe or malicious. Common indicators include links to spam, malware distribution, scanning behavior, or brute-force attempts.

## Domain Reputation

### What is it?  
Domain reputation analysis involves assessing the legitimacy, history, and behavior of a domain. It helps identify domains involved in phishing, malware delivery, command-and-control infrastructure, or other suspicious activity.

## File Reputation

### What is it?  
File reputation services determine whether a file is considered malicious or safe based on previous scans, behavioral analysis, and intelligence feeds. This allows quick triage without needing to reverse engineer or sandbox every file manually.
