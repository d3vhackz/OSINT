# Threat Intelligence and Internet Scanners

## Threat Intelligence

### What is it?  
Threat intelligence involves collecting, analyzing, and applying information about potential or active threats. This can include adversary behavior, malware artifacts, infrastructure patterns, and TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures). It enables defenders to anticipate, detect, and respond to cyber threats more effectively.

### Tools

- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) – Aggregates malware samples, domain/IP intelligence, and related artifacts.
- [Pulsedive](https://pulsedive.com/) – Provides threat intelligence enrichment and correlation across multiple sources.
- [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) – Framework for understanding adversary behaviors based on real-world observations.
- [AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com/) – Community-driven threat sharing platform with IPs, hashes, domains, and TTPs.
- [MISP Threat Sharing](https://www.misp-project.org/) – Open-source threat intelligence platform for sharing IOCs and context.
- [ThreatMiner](https://www.threatminer.org/) – Offers contextual threat intelligence data on domains, files, and actors.

## Internet Scanners

### What is it?  
Internet scanners are tools that actively scan the public internet to detect devices, open ports, services, and known vulnerabilities. These tools help security teams discover exposed infrastructure, monitor attack surfaces, and assess risk at scale.

### Tools

- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) – Search engine for internet-connected devices and services.
- [Censys](https://censys.io/) – Real-time internet scanning platform offering deep insights into assets and vulnerabilities.
- [ZoomEye](https://www.zoomeye.org/) – Cyber search engine for identifying networked devices, services, and vulnerabilities.
- [3E](https://www.3enigma.com/) – Threat intelligence and scanning platform (note: commercial, may require access).
